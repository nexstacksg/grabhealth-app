# Multi-Level Commission Structure

## Business Model Overview

Products are sourced from the platform owner and sold through two main channels:
1. **Authorized Partners (Companies)**
2. **Individual Sales Representatives**

## Commission Distribution

Our multi-level commission structure is designed to reward both direct sales and leadership while maintaining a sustainable business model. Here's how the commissions are distributed when a sale is made:

### For Direct Sales (Individual Sales Reps):
1. **Sales Representative**: 30%
   - Directly receives 30% of the product price
   - This is the first-level commission
   - Paid to the salesperson who closes the deal

2. **Team Leader**: 10%
   - Receives 10% of the product price
   - This is the second-level commission
   - Goes to the immediate supervisor of the sales representative

3. **Platform Owner**: 5%
   - Receives 5% of the product price
   - This is the platform fee for providing the sales infrastructure
   - Covers platform maintenance and support

### For Partner Companies:
- **Partner Company**: 5%
  - Receives 5% of the product price
  - For providing management and support to their sales team
  - Handles their own commission distribution to their sales force

### Example Calculation (Direct Sale):
For a product sold at $1,000:
- Sales Rep: $1,000 × 30% = $300
- Team Leader: $1,000 × 10% = $100
- Platform Owner: $1,000 × 5% = $50
- Remaining 55% goes to product costs and business operations

### Example Calculation (Partner Sale):
For a product sold at $1,000 through a partner:
- Partner Company: $1,000 × 5% = $50
- Platform Owner: $1,000 × 5% = $50
- Remaining 90% is managed by the partner for their operations and commissions

## Key Benefits:
- **Flexible Sales Channels**: Supports both individual sales reps and partner companies
- **Clear Revenue Sharing**: Transparent commission structure for all parties
- **Platform Sustainability**: 5% platform fee ensures continuous service improvement
- **Scalable Model**: Works for both independent salespeople and larger partner organizations

## Implementation Notes:
- Commissions are calculated on the final sale price before taxes
- Payouts are processed monthly
- Minimum sales thresholds may apply for commission eligibility
- Commission rates are subject to review and may be adjusted based on company policies

- **Honey Ginseng**: Customer Price ($1,000) - Sales Price ($700) = $300 commission
- **Ginseng Water**: Customer Price ($18.90) - Sales Price ($13.23) = $5.67 commission
